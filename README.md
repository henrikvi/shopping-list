# Shopping list

A minimalist grocery app with some specific features to improve the quality of life and grocery shopping experience of me and my girlfriend.

Planned features:
* A list of items that are
   * removed when checked
   * sorted by type / section
* Add items to a pool to be re-used
* Edit items and possible additional information
* Share a list between users
* Some kind of login / user management thing

Objectives:
* React is fairly (very) new to me, so expecting confusion in how to structure state, components etc.
* Learn something about progressive web apps, since the scope of the app is fairly simple. (Maybe learn about React Native?)

Tools used:
* https://github.com/mars/heroku-cra-node
* https://material-ui.com/
