# Shopping list

A minimalist grocery app with some specific features to improve the quality of life and grocery shopping experience of me and my girlfriend.

Planned features:
* A list of items that are
   * removed when checked
   * sorted by type / section
* Add items to a pool to be re-used
* Edit items and possible additional information
* Some kind of login / user management
* Share a list between users

Objectives:
* React is very new to me, so expecting confusion and learning experiences in how to structure state, components etc.
* Apply concepts from fullstackopen.com in a real-world example
* Actually create a "finished", usable project
* Maybe later: Learn something about progressive web apps or React Native?

Tools used:
